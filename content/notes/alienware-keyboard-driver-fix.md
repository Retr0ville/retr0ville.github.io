###  USB Descriptor Failed Device Fix

> A Windows startup tool that automatically detects USB devices with "Device Descriptor Request
> Failed" errors (Code 43), prompts you to uninstall them, and then puts the PC to sleep and wakes it
> back up.

## Background

The Alienware M16 R4 has a persistent issue where the keyboard randomly stops working after a restart due to a race condition in the way it loads up USB drivers. I was able to figure out a fix which involves uninstalling the failing USB driver and then putting the device to sleep and waking it up. This program is a way for me to automate and run that process in the background so I won't have to think about it.

Reference: [Alienware M15 R4 Keyboard Driver Issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/Alienware/comments/17nqy5y/alienware_m15_r4_keyboard_driver_issue_solution/)

## Problem

When USB devices fail to initialize properly, Windows shows:
- "Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. (Code 43)"
- "A request for the USB device descriptor failed."

## Solution

This script runs on startup/login, detects the problematic drivers, and tries to fix it automatically.

## Features

- Automatic detection of USB descriptor failed device

- GUI prompt for user confirmation

- Uninstall problematic device

- Put PC to sleep and auto-wake after 10 seconds

- Runs as scheduled task on startup and login

  

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `UsbDescriptorFix.ps1` | Main script |
| `Install-UsbFixStartup.ps1` | Install as startup task |
| `Uninstall-UsbFixStartup.ps1` | Remove startup task |

## Installation

1. Right-click `Install-UsbFixStartup.ps1`
2. Select "Run with PowerShell"
3. Approve the UAC prompt

The script will now run automatically on Windows startup and when you log in.

## Manual Usage

To run manually at any time:

1. Right-click `UsbDescriptorFix.ps1`
2. Select "Run with PowerShell"
3. Approve the UAC prompt

## Uninstallation

To remove the automatic startup task:

1. Right-click `Uninstall-UsbFixStartup.ps1`
2. Select "Run with PowerShell"
3. Approve the UAC prompt

Or run in PowerShell as Admin:
```powershell
Unregister-ScheduledTask -TaskName 'UsbDescriptorFix_Startup' -Confirm:$false
```

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- PowerShell 5.1+
- Administrator privileges (auto-elevates)

## How It Works

1. On startup/login, the script scans for USB devices with:
   - Status: Error
   - InstanceId starting with `USB\`
   - "Device Descriptor Request Failed" in name
   - Problem code 43 (Code 43)

2. If devices are found, a dialog appears showing:
   - Number of affected devices
   - Device names

3. When you click "Uninstall && Sleep":
   - Devices are uninstalled using PowerShell PnP cmdlets
   - A scheduled wake task is created
   - PC enters sleep mode
   - PC wakes after 10 seconds
   - Wake task is automatically cleaned up

## Troubleshooting

**Script doesn't detect devices:**
- Make sure you're running as Administrator
- Check Device Manager to confirm the device shows with "Error" status

**Script closes immediately:**
- Run from PowerShell console to see error messages
- Check log file at: `%TEMP%\UsbDescriptorFix_Log.txt`

**Uninstall fails:**
- Some USB devices may be protected
- Try using Device Manager manually: Right-click device → Uninstall device

## Logs

Debug logs are written to:
- `%TEMP%\UsbDescriptorFix_Log.txt` - Uninstall attempt logs
- `%TEMP%\UsbDescriptorFix_Debug.txt` - Script execution debug info
